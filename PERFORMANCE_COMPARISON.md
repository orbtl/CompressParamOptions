- **Memory Usage**: Bitwise operations still use 5.8% to 17.8% less memory
- **Trade-off**: Bitwise compression gains vs. string decompression speed

### Overall Assessment

**Bitwise Operations Advantages:**
- ✅ Significantly lower memory usage across all scenarios
- ✅ Faster compression performance
- ✅ Better scalability with larger datasets
- ✅ More consistent performance across different map types

**String Operations Advantages:**
- ✅ Faster decompression performance
- ✅ Simpler implementation and debugging
- ✅ Less complex bit manipulation logic

## Recommendations

1. **Use Bitwise Operations** for applications where:
   - Memory efficiency is critical
   - Compression is performed more frequently than decompression
   - Large datasets are processed regularly

2. **Consider String Operations** for applications where:
   - Decompression speed is more critical than compression speed
   - Code simplicity and maintainability are priorities
   - Memory usage is not a primary concern

3. **Hybrid Approach**: Consider implementing both approaches and choosing based on runtime conditions or user preferences.

## Test Environment
- Node.js environment with Vitest testing framework
- Performance tests run with 100-1000 iterations per measurement
- Memory measurements using Node.js `process.memoryUsage()`
- All tests performed on the same hardware configuration
